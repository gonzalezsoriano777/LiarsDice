Things you need (Real World idea ) : 
1). A minimum two players
2). 14 Dice 

Game setup:
3). A set of rules about what dice you can claim
4). Minimum of 7 rounds && Maximum of 13 rounds
5). Cup or some sort of hidden container to conceal rolled dice


Classes can be thoroughly considered : 
A). Die class for Dice functionality
B). Cup/Hand class for 7 Dice
C). Console/Main class to take an input from player and uses it res. into game
D). Game class to init/keep or even remove (Optional.. extra practice) players
E). Lastly, keeps track of score and ends once player has no dice => 
		Resulting in the other player winning
